What is better? Linear Annealed or Epsilon Greedy
-> In barryworld (and wordsworld) epsilon greedy seems to be make the learning faster.

New consideration:
-> normal linear anealation starts from epsilon 1.0 to 0.2
-> other distributions such as 0.5->0.1 work better, maybe even better than just epsilon greedy

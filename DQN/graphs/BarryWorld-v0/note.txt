The name of the graphs gives info about how they were trained.
(episodes):policy:episode_length:history_rep-sequence.png

-> episodes = the number of episodes trianed
-> policy = what epsilon policy was used?
    -> epsgr = epsilon greedy 0.2
    -> linan/linanX-Y = linear annealed 1.0->0.2/ linear annealed 0.A->0.B
-> episode_length = How many steps can the agent take per episode
-> history_rep = what history representation was used
-> sequence = what was the desired sequence to learn
  -> words_world = what string
  -> barry_world = what order of buttons
